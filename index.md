# Ä€to License Generator

Create intellectual property licenses for all your NFTs.

## Overview

The [`ato-api-form.html`](https://github.com/ATO-nft/api-client/blob/main/ato-api-form.html) page includes a form displaying parameters to set. When the form is submitted, the API sends an intellectual property license (pdf file) in response (in English and French). This file can then be stored and added to the NFT metadata.

## Test
